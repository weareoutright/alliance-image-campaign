                            <h4 class="faq-content__question">What does a typical home visit involve?</h4>
                            <p class="faq-content__answer">A home visit is designed around a patient's unique needs and care plan but starts with a comprehensive assessment of their physical and emotional status, including monitoring vital signs, managing symptoms, and performing necessary treatments like wound care or medication administration. Caregiver education is also a key part of visits.</p>

                            <p class="faq-content__answer">Hospital nursing is task-oriented and focused on stabilizing acute conditions in a structured environment with a large healthcare team. Home care nursing is patient-centered, focusing on care management, rehabilitation, and patient education in the patient's home. Home care nurses have more autonomy and a one-on-one relationship with patients, while still utilizing the hands-on skills and techniques required in hospital nursing.</p>

                            <h4 class="faq-content__question">Do I need special certifications or training?</h4>
                            <p class="faq-content__answer">In most home care settings special training is not required beyond a valid nursing license. New care at home nurses receive tailored training and orientation from their organization and the other members of the care team. Additionally, many nursing schools do offer home care-specific training rotations.</p>

                            <p class="faq-content__answer">In home care, nurses are part of an interdisciplinary team that works collaboratively to care for patients, with the nurse often acting as the central point of coordination, communication, and care management.</p>

                            <p class="faq-content__answer">Home care nurses are surrounded by additional supports on their team, from the training of more experienced nurses to collaborative work with the other disciplines in the field, while nurses maintain their autonomy they are not expected to operate without a support system and proper training.</p>

                            <h4 class="faq-content__question">What kinds of patients receive home-based care?</h4>
                            <p class="faq-content__answer">Home based care spans a wide array of patient types, from those recovering from acute illness or injury in home health to those living with a terminal illness receiving hospice care. Though many home based care patients are 65 and older, home care also supports pediatric patients and adults of all ages depending on their needs.</p>

                        <div class="faq-content__item">
                            <h4 class="faq-content__question">Do I see the same patients, or are they always changing?</h4>
                            <p class="faq-content__answer">Each nurse carries a case load of patients and typically sees the same patients throughout their time receiving home care. This enables nurses to develop meaningful relationships that enable high-quality, individualized care delivery, and instill a greater sense of purpose into each visit. Since some types of home care (i.e. hospice) include 24/7 coverage, nurses may also choose to serve as on-call, admissions, or triage nurses that allow them to see a variety of patients each day.</p>

                            <h4 class="faq-content__question">How is patient interaction unique in home visits?</h4>
                            <p class="faq-content__answer">Patient interaction is unique in home care because nurses and care team members are guests in their patient's home environment, allowing them to understand the patient's situation holistically, informing personalized care, and shifting the power dynamic to empower patients to live on their own terms.</p>
